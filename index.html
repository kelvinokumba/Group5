      <h1>THE BIG FIVE</h1>
      <p>
        In Africa, the Big Five game animals are the Lion, Leopard, Rhinoceros,  Elephant, and Buffalo. They are among the most famous of Africa's large animals. The term was coined by big-game hunters, and refers to the five most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot but is now more widely used by game viewing tourists and safari tour operators.
